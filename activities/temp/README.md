1. "Optimization as Interface" — Interactive Constraint Solver
Build a simple GUI or command-line tool where users type their output goals (e.g., “make it hotter but reduce emissions”), and the backend uses your neural constraint optimization model to update the inputs.
Backend: Your constraint optimization code
Frontend: Streamlit / CLI mock
Small dataset or even synthetic
Show a few demo cases + user-style experiments
✅ New angle: ML + user goals
✅ Fast to execute
✅ Publishable as HCI / AI tooling / optimization

3. Physics-Aware Diffusion Denoising
Use a physics equation (e.g., heat diffusion, wave propagation) as a “truth generator” and train a small denoiser model to recover clean state from noise-corrupted simulations.
Simulate dirty PDE solutions (heat, wave, fluid)
Train a small CNN or U-Net to denoise
Compare to traditional numerical smoothing
Bonus: Add constraints or boundary learning
✅ Fast, visually compelling
✅ Could be in applied physics + ML + PDE venues

5. Multi-Agent Sim to Learn Communication
Toy 2D agents try to pass a ball, but must learn to communicate a plan through a latent vector.
Use PyBullet or a 2D engine (even simple matplotlib sim)
Each agent gets partial info (e.g., obstacle location)
Must encode + decode a message to cooperate
Train with reward on success + message efficiency
✅ Publishable as an emergent communication or RL paper
✅ Code is small but the idea is hot

7. AI-Powered Calibration of Analog Sensors
Show that an NN can learn to calibrate noisy analog sensors (e.g., thermocouples, light sensors) better than a polynomial or linear fit.
Simulate realistic sensor drift or nonlinearity
Train MLP or 1D CNN to calibrate
Benchmark vs. traditional fitting
✅ Very practical
✅ Could submit to applied AI, embedded ML venues
✅ Can even run on MCU/Orin Nano later

9. Automatic Signature Similarity via Vision Embeddings
Turn your art authentication idea into a technical paper.
Use CLIP or ResNet to embed signatures
Compute similarity scores between known and unknown samples
Small dataset (10–100 images) is enough
Visualize t-SNE or PCA embeddings + similarity matrix
✅ Fast, novel use case
✅ Publishable in applied vision or digital humanities/forensics

---

11. Procedural Data Generation for Model Robustness
Show that procedurally generated training data (e.g., basic 2D or 3D shapes) can pre-train a model that adapts better to real-world data.
Simulate simple shapes with variable lighting/background
Train a ResNet on this
Fine-tune on small real dataset (e.g., CIFAR subset)
Show robustness gains
✅ Ties into game/graphics work if desired
✅ Can use Unity or Python simulation
✅ Publishable in data-centric AI venues
