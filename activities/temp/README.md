# Physics-Aware Denoising with Diffusion from Scratch

This project uses a synthetic dataset generated from known PDEs (partial differential equations) and applies a deep learning model to recover clean physical fields from noisy versions. It builds on a custom **diffusion model from scratch**, without requiring external pretrained models or datasets.

## üî¨ Project Summary
We simulate noisy versions of physical phenomena governed by PDEs (e.g., the heat equation), and train a neural network (e.g., CNN or U-Net) to reconstruct the original, clean solution.

## ‚úÖ Key Highlights
- **All data is synthetic**: no external datasets used
- **Physics-informed setup**: data generated from known PDEs (e.g., heat diffusion)
- **Uses stable diffusion from scratch**: custom-built, no pretrained models
- **No retraining required**: pretrained scratch diffusion is adapted directly to the denoising task

## üß™ Workflow
1. **Simulate Clean Data**
   - Use 2D finite-difference heat equation solver
   - Store snapshots of clean field `U_clean`

2. **Corrupt with Noise**
   - Add Gaussian noise or salt-and-pepper to get `U_noisy`

3. **Train Neural Denoiser**
   - Model: CNN or U-Net
   - Input: `U_noisy`
   - Output: `U_clean`

4. **Compare to Baselines**
   - Traditional smoothing: Gaussian blur, median filter
   - Metrics: MSE, PSNR, SSIM, visual difference

5. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add boundary condition masks
   - Use time-aware inputs
   - Try multiple PDEs (e.g., wave, Poisson)

## üìÅ Dataset
- Shape: `64x64` 2D grids
- Format: `.npy` or `.png`
- Fields: `(U_noisy, U_clean)` pairs
- Dataset size: 1000 samples (expandable)

## üß† Model

# Brushstroke Similarity Scoring via Vision Embeddings

## Overview

This project explores a novel method for quantifying stylistic similarity between paintings by analyzing brushstroke texture using self-supervised vision embeddings. Rather than focusing on content, composition, or signature, we train a model to learn the *style identity* of painters, particularly the brushstroke characteristics that are hard to forge.

By using contrastive learning with models like CLIP or DINOv2, we embed full or cropped images of paintings and train the system to recognize stylistic similarity between works by the same artist (e.g., Louis Ritman) and distinguish them from others.

---

## Goal

Train a vision-based model to:

* Identify stylistic consistency across paintings by the same artist
* Compute a **brushstroke similarity score** between unknown and known works
* Enable scalable, reusable stylistic analysis for art authentication

---

## Methodology

### üîç Embedding Backbone

* Use frozen CLIP or DINOv2 models to extract 512‚Äì1024D embeddings from image crops
* These embeddings capture texture, edge, contrast, and brushstroke implicitly

### üß™ Contrastive Learning (Triplet or InfoNCE)

* Train a small model to minimize distance between paintings by the same artist (positive pairs) and maximize distance from other artists (negative pairs)

### üì• Data Setup

* \~10 high-resolution paintings per artist
* Crop each painting into 3‚Äì5 regions with visible brush texture
* Artists: Louis Ritman, Jos√© Vel√°squez, Jean Salabet, Michel Delacroix, etc.
* Total: \~300‚Äì500 image crops

### üß† Training Objective

Use contrastive loss:

* Anchor: A crop from one Ritman painting
* Positive: A crop from a different Ritman painting
* Negative: A crop from another artist

Result: The model learns to embed brushstroke style in latent space

Paper Idea: ‚ÄúNeural Constraint-Based Password Auditor: A New Approach to Password Quality Enforcement‚Äù
‚úÖ Core Idea:
Use a neural constraint optimization model to reverse-engineer plausible user passwords that satisfy common password rules ‚Äî length, character mix, entropy ‚Äî and show how bad policies can be gamed and how better constraints reduce guessability.
üß† Key Insight:
Traditional password policies (e.g., ‚Äúone uppercase, one number‚Äù) often produce predictable formats (e.g., Password1!)
Your model treats the rules as constraints and generates passwords that meet them
You measure how similar they are to real user-chosen passwords (e.g., leaked corp datasets or synthetically modeled ones)
You show that policies which encourage low-entropy ‚Äúrule-compliance‚Äù lead to more predictable passwords
üß™ Method Steps:
Constraint-based Input Optimization Model
Inputs: latent seed vector
Constraints: must match a policy (e.g., regex, entropy floor, char set rules)
Output: synthetic password string that satisfies the constraints
Similarity Evaluation
Compare generated passwords to real-world datasets (e.g., RockYou, LinkedIn dumps)
Use Levenshtein, character entropy, n-gram distribution, etc.
Policy Weakness Audit
Run your model with several common policies
Show which ones produce most ‚Äúguessable‚Äù passwords
Recommend better constraint design
üìä Experimental Setup:
Use synthetic data OR public leaks (RockYou, etc.)
Generate 10,000 passwords per policy
Score each batch using:
Entropy metrics
Markov likelihood based on real password models
Similarity to known leaks
üß© Publishable Contributions:
First use of neural constraint optimization to generate passwords from policy rules
Novel method to audit password policies from the inside-out
Clear applied relevance + security implications
Tiny dataset needed, easy to simulate everything
üïí Timeline:
Task	Time
Basic model reuse from your constraint code	1‚Äì2 days
Write 3‚Äì5 policies (regex + entropy)	1 day
Generate samples + metrics	2‚Äì3 days
Visualize results, write paper	3‚Äì4 days

# Neural Constraint-Based String Generation for Security: Passwords and Cryptographic Keys

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of neural constraint optimization to generate **structured strings** for cybersecurity applications, focusing on two use cases:

1. **Passwords** ‚Äî Reverse-engineer user-style passwords that meet specific policy constraints.
2. **Cryptographic Keys** ‚Äî Generate structured cryptographic strings (e.g., MD5-prone inputs, vanity Ethereum addresses) while analyzing security tradeoffs.

All string outputs are generated using a learned latent vector input and a neural decoder, optimized to satisfy policy constraints and metrics such as entropy, formatting, and structure.

---

## Use Case 1: Password Policy Auditor

### Objective

Evaluate how different password policies lead to predictable or unpredictable password formats using a constraint-optimization framework.

### Pipeline

* **Input**: Latent vector `z`
* **Decoder**: Transformer-style decoder to produce password strings
* **Constraints**:

  * Minimum length
  * Regex (e.g., at least one uppercase, one number, one special char)
  * Minimum entropy threshold
* **Loss**: Sum of penalties for unmet constraints
* **Optimization**: Gradient descent on `z` to minimize constraint loss

### Metrics

* Entropy per password
* Levenshtein similarity to leaked password corpora (e.g., RockYou)
* n-gram overlap or Markov likelihood (optional)

### Outcome

* Show that many common policies lead to **predictable patterns** (e.g., Password1!)
* Recommend stronger constraints that increase entropy and structural unpredictability

---

## Use Case 2A: MD5 Collision Generator (Easy Crypto)

### Objective

Demonstrate how weak hash functions (e.g., MD5) can be influenced by constraint-driven input generation to produce **collidable or low-diff outputs**.

### Pipeline

* **Target**: Two generated strings should have MD5 hashes with **low Hamming distance**
* **Constraints**:

  * Must be valid UTF-8 strings (or printable ASCII)
  * Optional structure: prefix, length, char mix
  * Loss = MD5 distance + constraint penalties

### Evaluation

* Hamming distance between hash pairs
* Visualize clusterability of hashes
* Compare against random string generation baseline

---

## Use Case 2B: Vanity Ethereum Address Generator (Hard Crypto)

### Objective

Use constraint optimization to generate Ethereum private keys whose public addresses meet **vanity constraints** (e.g., start with `0xdeadbeef`)

### Pipeline

* **Input**: Latent vector `z` decoded into private key (hex)
* **Transform**: Use elliptic curve to derive public address (via eth\_keys lib or web3.py)
* **Constraints**:

  * Private key must be valid (256-bit hex)
  * Public address must match regex (e.g., `starts_with("dead")`)
  * Optional: entropy or randomness loss

### Evaluation

* Success rate of vanity match
* Entropy of generated private keys
* Tradeoff curves: vanity constraint vs entropy loss

---

## Implementation Notes

* No RNNs used (Transformer or MLP decoder only)
* Use differentiable approximations of entropy, regex, etc. for backprop
* Entire project can be run without training data (purely generative)
* Bonus: Add GUI/Streamlit interface for interactive constraint selection

---

## Publishable Contributions

* First unified framework for **constraint-optimized security string generation**
* Reveals structural vulnerabilities in password and crypto-string policies
* Blends **applied cybersecurity**, **generative modeling**, and **optimization**
