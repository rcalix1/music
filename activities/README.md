# AI Research Portfolio README

This document summarizes 3 strategically aligned research projects, grounded in real systems (blast furnace, energy data, RC flight), and infused with cutting-edge AI methods (preference learning, latent modeling, self-critique, and autonomous control).

## ü•á Project 1: Preference-Based Time Series GPTs

**Theme**: Fine-tune GPT-style models for time series forecasting using preference-based methods instead of traditional supervision.

### Key Concepts

* **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization)
* **GRPO** (Gradient Reward Preference Optimization)
* **SPO** (Score-based Preference Optimization ‚Äì proposed)
* Preference signals from score metrics (R^2, RMSE) or human annotations

### Applications

* Blast furnace silicon prediction
* UCI Appliances Energy dataset

### Inspirations

### Goals

* Replace labeled regression losses with preference-based loops
* Fine-tune GPTs with human or score-derived preferences
* Extend to self-refining loops with critic models (see Project 3)

### Domains

* UCI Energy Prediction dataset 
* Blast furnace time series

### Goals

* Predict future latent states rather than raw sensor values
* Learn internal representations that minimize surprise
* Move toward agents that simulate and reason with latent futures
