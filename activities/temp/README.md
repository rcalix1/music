Paper Idea: “Neural Constraint-Based Password Auditor: A New Approach to Password Quality Enforcement”
✅ Core Idea:
Use a neural constraint optimization model to reverse-engineer plausible user passwords that satisfy common password rules — length, character mix, entropy — and show how bad policies can be gamed and how better constraints reduce guessability.
🧠 Key Insight:
Traditional password policies (e.g., “one uppercase, one number”) often produce predictable formats (e.g., Password1!)
Your model treats the rules as constraints and generates passwords that meet them
You measure how similar they are to real user-chosen passwords (e.g., leaked corp datasets or synthetically modeled ones)
You show that policies which encourage low-entropy “rule-compliance” lead to more predictable passwords
🧪 Method Steps:
Constraint-based Input Optimization Model
Inputs: latent seed vector
Constraints: must match a policy (e.g., regex, entropy floor, char set rules)
Output: synthetic password string that satisfies the constraints
Similarity Evaluation
Compare generated passwords to real-world datasets (e.g., RockYou, LinkedIn dumps)
Use Levenshtein, character entropy, n-gram distribution, etc.
Policy Weakness Audit
Run your model with several common policies
Show which ones produce most “guessable” passwords
Recommend better constraint design
📊 Experimental Setup:
Use synthetic data OR public leaks (RockYou, etc.)
Generate 10,000 passwords per policy
Score each batch using:
Entropy metrics
Markov likelihood based on real password models
Similarity to known leaks
🧩 Publishable Contributions:
First use of neural constraint optimization to generate passwords from policy rules
Novel method to audit password policies from the inside-out
Clear applied relevance + security implications
Tiny dataset needed, easy to simulate everything
🕒 Timeline:
Task	Time
Basic model reuse from your constraint code	1–2 days
Write 3–5 policies (regex + entropy)	1 day
Generate samples + metrics	2–3 days
Visualize results, write paper	3–4 days
